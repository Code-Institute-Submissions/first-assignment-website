BRAINSTORM:
1. Color Scheme:
    Are ya yellow?!: #feda6a

    Silver Fox: #d4d4dc

    Bootstrap Grey: #333A40

    Dark Slate: #1d1e22

2. I think that the contact form should be modelled after the one on glint, 
whereby the border of the box changes color after the form is filled, 
form validation can be displayed below that box.

3. I think that the photos in the gallery section should be in black and white.
